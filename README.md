# Data Augmentation Exploration for Deepfakes Detection

## Abstract
> In recent years, methods for realistic face swapping and manipulation commonly known as "deepfakes" are rapidly evolving thanks to the advances in deep generative models, which has led to the potential of abuse of individuals or the propagation of fake news. Although many solutions to detect forged videos have been propose, none seem to have paid attention to the data augmentation step. 
Data Augmentation techniques are widely used to enhance the size and quality of training datasets to reduce the problem of limited data when training deep learning models.
